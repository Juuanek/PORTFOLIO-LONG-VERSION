## <p align="center"><a name="aboutme"> 🤗 ABOUT ME 🤗 </a>
My name is Janek and I am developing myself in many things. Mostly software testing and all around IT. I would like to change my job to something with more opportunities to grow and to learn continuously. I find it really enjoying to do anything on the computer. Since I was little I always liked to break something to have later something to fix. I did a lot and I think I know a lot about computers in every field. From installing windows to optimalization to components changing and even to writing some programs in Java for presonal purposes. I am an always learner. I did't know it till few weeks ago, when I realized that almost every time I do something I try to do it as best as I can and try to combine business and pleasure. So when I watch a movie I watch it in other language, when I work I listen to podcasts, when I drive I listen to something inspiring or scientific. Almost all the time I try to push myself to learn something new to invest in myself which is the best investment. I dedicated myself in lifelong development of my true self. I am continously developing myself in becoming more and more better in every field I participate. "You can always become a little bit better in the things you do" I am adapting this quote to every field of my life.

 My projects and expirence are mostly thanks to uTest platfrom for testers around the world. This platform makes opportunity for every tester no matter who and where from.
They performs services for huge companies around the world in testing their apps, devices, webs, and much more. I started testing on uTest in Januray 2024 and I made some really good progress and became respected around companies for work that I do. For now I am at bronze level of uTest Certification and I am constantly working on developing my skills in testing so I can rank up in levels. 




## <p align="center"><a name="languages"> 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 LANGUAGES 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 </a>
As languages are really important part of every kind of job in IT I decided to write a little about it and how it looks in my life. 
- **English** - Thats why I am writing all my sources in English is to show you that I can use it and use it well I think. I wrote whole portfolio and CV in English 
and I try to use it as much as I can to be better and better. I watch movies, listen to podcasts, read books in this language and have very little difficulties overall. It may be a little more time consuming with some 
unusual phrases, or words that I just don't know yet. I love this language and hope to use it in my future work almost all the time.

- **Italian** - I spent 7 months in Italy in two parts. First I went on practices, and second time I went to take part in an intern opportunity. At that time I could speak almost fluently in English so I knew
it won't be hard for me to learn the next one. And I started to learn and became a communicative in this language in a really short period of time. I would describe myself in this language as A1 
because I can exchange thoughts with italians. But it is not like I am native or something. Just huge basics and really good understanding in practice at work not from books.

- **Spanish** - I have learned this language for a few years before I started learning Italian. Spanish helped me to better understand Italian language. For now my Spanish understanding is a little outdated
because of lack of time. But this is on my list after becoming really good in Italian to become fluent also in Spanish. What I can tell (what even surprised me)
was when we had a visitation at work from Spanish mother factory. I could communicate with spanish people as well as almost anyone else and I almost did't need to use a translator.

Connecting my English skills with Italian and Spanish and confidency to speak in other language without fear of being rejected makes me a really international human being.
