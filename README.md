## <p align="center"><a name="aboutme"> 🤗 ABOUT ME 🤗 </a>
My name is Janek and I am developing myself in many things. Mostly software testing and all around IT. I would like to change my job to something with more opportunities to grow and to learn continuously. I find it really enjoying to do anything on the computer. Since I was little I always liked to break something to have later something to fix. I did a lot and I think I know a lot about computers in every field. From installing windows to optimalization to components changing and even to writing some programs in Java for presonal purposes. I am an always learner. I did't know it till few weeks ago, when I realized that almost every time I do something I try to do it as best as I can and try to combine business and pleasure. So when I watch a movie I watch it in other language, when I work I listen to podcasts, when I drive I listen to something inspiring or scientific. Almost all the time I try to push myself to learn something new to invest in myself which is the best investment. I dedicated myself in lifelong development of my true self. I am continously developing myself in becoming more and more better in every field I participate. "You can always become a little bit better in the things you do" I am adapting this quote to every field of my life.

## <p align="center"><a name="languages"> 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 LANGUAGES 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 </a>
As languages are really important part of every kind of job in IT I decided to write a little about it and how it looks in my life. 
- **English** - Thats why I am writing all my sources in English is to show you that I can use it and use it well I think. I wrote whole portfolio and CV in English 
and I try to use it as much as I can to be better and better. I watch movies, listen to podcasts, read books in this language and have very little difficulties overall. It may be a little more time consuming with some 
unusual phrases, or words that I just don't know yet. I love this language and hope to use it in my future work almost all the time.

- **Italian** - I spent 7 months in Italy in two parts. First I went on practices, and second time I went to take part in an intern opportunity. At that time I could speak almost fluently in English so I knew
it won't be hard for me to learn the next one. And I started to learn and became a communicative in this language in a really short period of time. I would describe myself in this language as A1 
because I can exchange thoughts with italians. But it is not like I am native or something. Just huge basics and really good understanding in practice at work not from books.

- **Spanish** - I have learned this language for a few years before I started learning Italian. Spanish helped me to better understand Italian language. For now my Spanish understanding is a little outdated
because of lack of time. But this is on my list after becoming really good in Italian to become fluent also in Spanish. What I can tell (what even surprised me)
was when we had a visitation at work from Spanish mother factory. I could communicate with spanish people as well as almost anyone else and I almost did't need to use a translator.

Connecting my English skills with Italian and Spanish and confidency to speak in other language without fear of being rejected makes me a really international human being.

## <p align="center"><a name="passions">  🚲 PASSIONS 🚲

 - I have got a lot of passions in my life, and I want to let you know that this part is going to be a little longer than others but I suppose that If you have come this far you will be interested in this part as well. As I said previously I have got a lot of passions in my life. Probably more than I can handle and have to use as much effort as I can to plan everything carefuly to get as much happiness of my passions as I can. I think I would start with cycling. I am a cyclist since 2008 with one year of professional cycling in Poland. Now I take part in some local races and try to keep my fit up to date and collect as much trophies as possible :). If you have never ridden a bike as an "racing amateur" you won't even believe how much time it takes to train and all the things around this sport. But I got used to it and it makes me so happy and powerfull after a 4 hour ride with friends. I service all of my bikes by myself and also started my own Bike Service Company and I have a lot of satisfied customers. 

 - In my life I really enjoy sports, that is why my another passion is Disc Golf. Mostly, people don't even know what sport it is as this is more popular in United States than in Poland. This is kind of game almost identical to usual golf but in this kind we use discs instead of balls. When you get into this sport very deep it is getting really really satisfying and relaxing beacuse disc golf courses are mostly localized in some green areas so you are walking through woods and plants breathe fresh air and thats why I think it is quite healthy kind of sport. We play together with friends and my brother and we are quite good as casual amateurs. We are also considering to take part in some local competitions but we didn't decide yet.

 - Now IT. I won't lie to you. Because you probably would like to hear that it is my number one passion and I do and I love everything about it. It is not. BUT... It is one of my passions since really really young age. I almost always had a computer in my home and with my brother as we weren't rich family we had a weak and slow computer. It is a miracle we even had one. But as it was so slow and so on. We had to be really carefull and clever to use it as we want to use it. In our young age was just to play a game that is totally overwhelming for our computer capabilities. And I tell you... We always could find a solution for every problem, mistake in this field that occured. Thats why now I feel really good and comfortable in computers is because i started really young and we had a lot of different problems that we had to resolve. So after I graduate my primary school I decided to go to IT school. But something inside me was talking to me that I already know everything I need to know in this field so I eventually decided to go to gastronomical school. Because I wanted to learn something new and not learn something that I already know. And the same thing happend to me in case of University choices I thought of IT but eventually choosen something different. And as I worked in my field of specialty I understood that IT is the thing that I was always designed to do as my carrer path.

 - I learned all needed knowledge about computers to be able to collect computer parts on my own and assemble my PC. I assembled 3 my own computers and few more for family and friends. I learned how to do it because of lack of money when I was young and I was trying to get my old weak parts as sharp as they can possibly be and when I had some money I started to replace them. After a few years of trying to have a computer that can handle my needs I realized I have almost no difficulty in assembeling or disassembeling or repairing a PCs. So when I had my dream computer ready I started to work on everybody's else computers and they were always happy and satisfied of how fast it can be because they never knew it can even work like this and for me this optimalisation was almost the question in my mind "How can I make my PC work faster without using any money" And I asked and I was looking for the answers and I found them.

 - When I was younger I used to play a lot of computer games. That is mostly why I needed to have a powerful computer to handle such requiring softwares. And it was the start of my journey through PCs efficiency and reliablity. And because we had no money to upgrade It was much harder to come up with ideas that can help improve performance in this kind of situation. 

- As I think about electronics I think it was something that was allways close to my heart which can sound a little strange. I had something in me that told me to break things apart look how they work and why they work. I usually broke things when I was taking them apart but later on I started to see that I am learning a lot when proceeding this process in almost every kind of thing that I am able to take apart. I am hugle fascinated about how things work from the inside and that is probably why now I know a lot about the insides about PCs and electronics allaround. 

## <p align="center"><a name="programminglanguages"> 󠁧󠁢 🎌 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 🎌 󠁧󠁢󠁥 </a>

- Java - In march 2022 I decided to start my journey with learning how to programm applications in Java. At the very beginning I started to learn on my own from courses and every other resources available in the Internet, but lately I decided to widen my horizonts taking up postgraduate studies on Merito University in Chorzow. I finished those studies with best possible grade outcome. As I started to search for job and training opportunities I found out that all the things I did untill then was not enough to get a job. So I started to learn for every other frameworks, languages ... that may have an impact on my job opportunities outcome. After a while I found out the perfect kind of job that would perfectly fit into something that I would like to do in my future job. And it would be automation tests with Selenium Web Driver. When I first found out this kind of driver and possibilities and oppportunities I immediately decided that this is the kind of job that I want to do. But for now I have to postpone this idea to close learnings that I started and firstly get along with manual tesing and later move to automation testing.

- SQL - I started to learn how to use sql because I started to see that this is kind of database language which is almost necessary in most of the projects. So I decided to learn how to use sql. I started with Mysql and then learned how to use it in PostgreSQL. I finished a few courses in this field and had a lot of exercises on my postgraduate studies. I find this field of IT really interesting and it makes me really satisfied when I am creating some kind of database or just searching through some database. I think it would be the right kind of field in my personal carrer to work in.
- SAP - SAP is one kind of software that we are using in our job industry so it is mandatory for me to constantly develope my skills that are connected with this software. Thats kind of system that is really clear for me but I can be a little bit overwhelming because of its huge possibilities. We use sap in our work for numerous processes and it helps us to control prodution quality. The biggest goal of sap in our industry is production quality.
- EXCEL - I use excel in my current and in my few pervious jobs. In my current job I use it mostly as a software to supervise production quality and quantity and as a prevention of maintanance of some kind of defects in production that can be prevented. I am not a professional excel user but I think I am quite good at this software because its quite easy to use though really powerfull. 
- HTML / CSS - I am beggining already my journey with html and css because I can see on the market those are really demanding skills that are necessary to be a powerfull candidate for a job. I see it also really interesting and I am planning to create two my own websites. One will be some kind of my blog of life and my passion and bussines. And the other one would be some kind of online shop for my fiancee that is selling handmade parts of wardrobe.
